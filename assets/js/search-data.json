If you decide to buy one, would it be a reliable, strong on the second hand and make you happy ? . These are some questions bugging my head when I decided to buy my first brand new car. I already decided the car, it was Toyota Corolla Hybrid, it was looking reliable, fuel efficient and good size for trunk. Also it is exciting to try new tech so being hybrid was also influencing. It was the third most selling car so it should be rather easy to sell it if I wanted to. As most people do, I’ve went and checked eksisozluk which would have an opinon as most of the things. Bu there were various ideas, some liked some not and decided to check for keywords about chronic problems etc. There were some listed and you can find it when you Google, but I was wondering if I could find users opion in summary. . So I decided to crawl some of the most used web sites for product reviews and complains. . I aimed to answer these three questions: . Can I find a useful information among those opions so that data can help me on my decision process? | Can I build something generic out of it so I can use for other products or maybe for other products also. | Can I find additional chronic problems or issues other than blogposts or googled answers? | import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from nltk.probability import FreqDist import gensim.corpora as corpora import gensim from pprint import pprint from pyLDAvis import gensim_models import pickle import pyLDAvis import os . /opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/past/builtins/misc.py:45: DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module&#39;s documentation for alternative uses from imp import reload .

Here we can see on sikayetvar.com topics are: . First topic is generally about engine. | Second one is about consumption. | Third one is similar to second but also about battery. | 3. Conclusion . It seems like I found answers to first two of my questions on beginning, so it seems like people liked the car and there are complaints about service and warranty. This approch can be transformed into a generic application so we can search for keywords and get a summary about products. However I could not find any chronic problem information on first glance. Maybe it can be derived with deeper analysis. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
